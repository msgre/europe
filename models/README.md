# Models for 3D Print

Some parts of the Gameboard required custom made pieces printed on a 3D printer.

Here are 3D models from Fusion 360 `*.f3d` and exported STL `*.stl` files for slicing software.

* Sensor Cover - cover for an optical sensor below the Gameboard's optical gates
* Reflector Holder - holder for a small reflector with NeoPixel RGB LED
